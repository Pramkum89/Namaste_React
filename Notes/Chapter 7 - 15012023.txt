- If we dont pass anything in dependency array, then useEffect is called everytime after rendering.If no dependency array 
is given, then useEffect() is called after each render. It is not dependent on any particular state. 
Each time after rendering is done, useEffect will be executed.
- If we pass [] empty array, then then useEffect is called only once after rendering.
- If we pass any state/s inside dependency array, then useEffect is called once after initial render and 
each time after state changes.

- React says that never create one compoennt inside another component. Keep it outside. Because each time rendering happens,
component will be created each time.

- Never ever write useState inside if-else; for . Because React doesnt like inconsistencies whether 
useState variable is created or not.

- useState is a hook given to use as a local state variable inside a component. 
Never use useState outside a functional component.

- We can create multiple useEffect hooks inside a single component.

- Import npm packages only when things get complex. Ex: Use formik library when more forms are requried.

HW:

- Why is CDN a great place to host images?
Because CDN is faster, caches image, optimized images are placed, returns very fast, 100% uptime.
- Read about multiple browser routers : Read react-router official docs

React-router
- Using latest version : 6+
- Import createBrowserRouter; is a function which help us create routing configuration.
- Import RouterProvider; a component which helps us to map app router to our app.
- If a wrong path is used in browser, then by default react-router-dom package provides a component that throws Unhandled error.

- Problem with anchor tag is that it refreshes the page on each click. So not useful for applications. We make use of Link 
to build Single Page Applications(SPA).
<a href ="/about" >  ==> reloads page
<Link to = "/about" > ==> doesnt reload page

- Two types of Routing:
1. Client side routing : get the pages from client only. (React applications)
2. Server side routing : get the pages through network calls (old - index.html loading from backend)

- Link uses <a> tag behind the scenes. But doesnt reload page as it does in <a> tag.

- Dynamic routing: Ex: /restaurant/:id
	useParams() : hook used to dynamically read url(params)

- More components helps in creating:	
Modular
Readable
Reusable
Maintainable
Testable

- What will happen if we write console.log( useState()) ?
	It returns a useState function on console 

- React Router enables "client side routing".
In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets,
 and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.
