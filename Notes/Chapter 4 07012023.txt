HW:

- Can we use React.Fragment inside React.Fragment
- Join items in an array
- Download json viewer extension for chrome
- Config driven UI
- Optional chaining
- Diff between arguments & parameters. ref: Namste Js
pass in args, receive parameters
spread operator
Map is the best way to do Functional progrmming.
map filter reduce in javascript
Diferencce between foreach and map?
Virtual DOM . Reconciliation. makes Reacct fast. 
React fiber. React16. Reconcilation engine. Diff.
- Why don't we use index as key?
no key (not acceptable) <<<< index key(ok - use only if you dont have ay unique key) <<< unique key (best)
- Read about React documentation: why not use index as key
****IntvQ:
- What is VirtualDOM?
- What is reconcliation?
- What are keys?
- Can we have index as key? Yes. But not good practice.

Session notes:

Build food Villa app: Coding

IMP***
1. Have a planning first
	- Design applayout on your notes what all components required for your app.

- Any JSX expression can have only one parent.
- Suppose if we want to include two parents, we wrap it inside <div> element.
- React gives us access to component React.Fragment (<>). imported from react library. 
It is like a empty tag which directly replaces onto root element. It reduces unnecessary overhead of including parent <div> tags.

- In functional componet, if "{" is used, then mandatory to write return statement to fetch elements.
- We can write React.Fragment inside React.Fragment.

*** Download json viewer - chrome extension plugin

- Ex: Swiggy. Some cities has carousel data, some doesnt have. The UI rendering happens through config sent from backend. 
***This is called as config-driven-ui.

- props is known as properties. "pass props" : pass data as props to the functional component.
Ex: <RestaurantCard restaurant = {restautantList[0]} />
props are passed to functional components via arguments and parameters just like functions.
Ex: function fn (params1, params2) { //-> Receive data in Parameters (rp)
....
}
fn("abc", "xyz")  -> Pass data in Arguments (pa)

***Virtual DOM
- Representation of DOM with us is known as Virtual DOM.

- Why we need Virtual DOM?
- we need Virtual DOM for reconciliation in React.
- Reconciliation is an algorithm that React uses to diff one tree(DOM) from another(VirtualDOM). It determines what needs 
to be changed in UI and what need not to be changed in UI.

- HMR algorithm is for files(uses File Watcher algorithms - Parcel). 
React reconciliation algorithm is for DOMs(uses diff algorithm - Browser).

- React fiber: New reconciliation engine(React 16 - changed diff algo)

***
- Never use index as a key if the order of elements may change. If no other properties of unique element, then only use index.
