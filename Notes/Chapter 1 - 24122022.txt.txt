Session 1: 24/12/2022

- React is a library.
- It takes minimum effort for a library to put it inside our code.
Ex: Carousel is a library.

Tools used:
- Google chrome
- VS code editor
- Extensions: Check screenshot

HW:
- What does emmet do?
- What is CDN?
- What is crossorigin in cdn?
- What is DOM?
- What is createElement in React?
- What is the difference between async and defer? Ref: Akshay saini vid on youtube
- Why css should be written inside head tag?
- What is rel,href, link tag?

******
- document from html comes from browser api's. JS engine provides it.
- Shortest program of Javascript: empty file
- Shortest program of React: importing react library(cdn links) in script tag.
- CDN imports two links:
1. react - it is the core library of react
2. react-dom - it is the web version of React. Gives access to Document Object Model(DOM).
- React element is an object.
- Generally, in all apps, we have one single root and one render method. We have portals to have multiple root(Advanced concept).

IntvQ: - If multiple elements are present inside root, then React overrides the root element.
Ex:   <div id="root">
        <div id"title">Hello World!</div>
        <div id"title">Hello World!</div>
        <div id"title">Hello World!</div>
        <div id"title">Hello World!</div>
        <div id"title">Hello World!</div>
      <!-- <h1>Namaste Everyone from html!</h1> -->
    </div>
	
Output: root element is overridden. hello World not shown in browser.
- "Not rendered" is written generally in React. 
If any application shows "Not rendered", it means there is issue, root not configured correctly.

- React came with the idea of writing html inside Javascript. But initial createElement is not user/developer friendly. 
That is when JSX came into picture in ES6.
- When id is used in html tag to refere element, use # in css file with css properties.

Assignment :

1. What is Emmet? 
- Emmet is a add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts which are then expanded into full pieces of code.
By using emmet, it allows developers to type less and save both on keypress and time.

2.  Difference between a Library and Framework? 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXA1zpv4DhA
- Library has rules & restrictions (HOME) while framework has mor rules  restrictions (University).
- In Library (JQuery), you are calling the code to the library whereas in Framework (Django), framework is calling your code.
Ex: you can call Jquery code (some function) anytime in your code, but in framework, templates folder should be as it is. 
It calls your code.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
- CDN is content delivery network. It allows us to access the static web information from the nearest servers. 
- Increases Perfformance, less time to access the web information.
- https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html

4. Why is React known as React?
- React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. 
When the data in a React component changes, React will automatically re-render the component so that it reflects the new data. 
This makes it easy to create performant user interfaces that always look up-to-date.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was first used internally at Facebook to power News Feed 
and other user interface elements. After seeing how well it performed, Jordan open-sourced React 
and made it available to the world. Since then, React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag? 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcLW5d0KAYE
CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM
- React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.
- The reason React and ReactDOM were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of React Native.
React contains functionality utilised in web and mobile apps. ReactDOM functionality is utilised only in web apps.

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
- react.development.js is used for development and is bigger in size. Not so stable.
react.production.js is used for production environment. It is minified version of library. Stable.
- Development mode includes useful warnings and gives you access to tools that make development and debugging easier. 
Production mode minifies your code and better represents the performance your app will have on end users' devices.

8. What is async and defer? - see my Youtube video ; 
Ref Screenshot for understanding
- In normal script tag, HTML parsing is done. As soon as script is found, script fetching is done from network 
and then execution starts. Only after script execution is completed, HTMl parsing is continued.
- In case of async, HTML parsing and script fetching happens asynchronously. Once script is loaded/fetched, 
then script execution happens. Only after script execution is completed, then only hrml parsing is continued.
- In case of defer, HTML parsing and script fetching is happened asynchronously. Only after html parsing is completed, 
then only script execution happens.
IMP: Ex:
1. async doesnt guarantee the order of execution of scripts. So if multiple scripts are inter-dependent, then defer is prefferred.
2. If scripts are independent (Google AI scripts-not related), then async is preferred.
