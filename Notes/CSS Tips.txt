CSS tips:

html element -> attribute type -> description 

div -> justify-content: space-between -> gives space between the div elements
div/span/li/h2 -> display: flex -> arranges the items one after other in single line than in multiple lines
ul -> list-style-type : none -> list will not be containing any dots, numbering 
img -> width:100% -> resize image to width of the parent element
div -> flex-wrap: wrap -> wraps the elements one after another as per page width
